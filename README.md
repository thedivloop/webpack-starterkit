# Webpack starter kit tutorial

This was made following the tutorial of [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs).

## Background

When I started doing unit testing on front end javascript I struggled because the browser is not able to call/link modules imported in the JS script on the fly. And of course nodeJS has a different global object and environment from the browser and the `window`. Bundling solves the issue, and webpack is one of the famous tools for that.

Enjoy!
